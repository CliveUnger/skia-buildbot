/*
To each 'filter' two AND clauses will be appended
that restricts the results to a one minute window.

To develop a query visit

 https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/ref_v2beta1/rest/v2beta1/entries/list

And use the APIs explorer at the end of the page to build
the query. You will also need to reference the structure
of LogEntry, which is how the data is stored:

https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/ref_v2beta1/rest/v2beta1/LogEntry

While you can use the Google Logging UI to explore logs
and build queries, realize that as of today the UI builds
V1 queries, which don't work with the V2 API.
